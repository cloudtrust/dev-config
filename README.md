This repository contains an example configuration for deploying Cloudtrust.
It is provided as an example, but is not directly usable as-is.
Configurations need to be adapted for each environment.

The complete deployment guide can be found at [cloudtrust.io](http://cloudtrust.io/doc/chapter-deploy/Deployment_Procedure_Cluster.html).
